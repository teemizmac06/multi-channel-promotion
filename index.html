    <p><strong>What is MCP?</strong></p>
    <p>Multi-Channel Promotion (MCP) is a high-impact strategy designed to skyrocket your Twitch channel’s visibility, engagement, and subscriber conversions across multiple platforms.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ This approach harnesses powerful tools like targeted social media campaigns, SEO-optimized landing pages, strategic influencer partnerships, urgency-driven promotions, and data-driven content scheduling to attract and retain a loyal audience.</li>
      <li>✅ MCP is designed to drive explosive viewership growth, convert casual viewers into dedicated subscribers, and establish a commanding online presence for your channel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How MCP Works</h2>
